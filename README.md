## About the site:

I built the website to serve as a platform to shed light on the organization *Son Irremplazables* ('They are irreplaceable' in Spanish). *Son Irremplazables* is a grassroots initiative committed to raising awareness about the issue of missing individuals in the Dominican Republic. By highlighting the disappearances and their impact, the website aims to bring attention to this pressing social concern, advocate for solutions, and support affected family members while they search for their loved ones.
